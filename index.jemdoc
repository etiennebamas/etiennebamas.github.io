== Hello!
Welcome to my webpage. I am a post-doctoral researcher at EPFL, affiliated to the group of [https://people.epfl.ch/emmanuel.abbe Prof. Emmanuel Abbé] in the Mathematics Institute, working on mathematics and reasoning in AI. Until now, I did most of my research in Theoretical Computer Science (specifically Combinatorial Optimization), but since 2025, I am also very interested in the topic of AI for mathematics. You can find more info about me [about_me.html here] or in my [CV/Simple_CV.pdf CV].

== Projects and advising
Below you can find the list of my publications. I also advised several student projects/MSc theses either on algorithms and theory or on more applied projects (see [pdf/PMLR1.pdf poster] for a more applied example).

== Publications
